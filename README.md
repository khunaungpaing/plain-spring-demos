# Plain Spring Demos

Welcome to the Plain Spring Demos repository! This collection of demo projects aims to provide beginners with reference materials for learning Spring Framework 5.3.x in its plain form, without Spring Boot. Each demo project focuses on a specific aspect of Spring, such as security, file uploading, WebSocket, OTP and more.

## Purpose
